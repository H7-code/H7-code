<p>👋 Howdy, fellow coders! I'm Hassan, a developer passionate about crafting innovative solutions and tackling challenging problems with code. 💻✨

🚀 Aspiring game and web developer 🎮🌐, I'm driven to create interactive, engaging experiences that merge creativity with functionality. My journey is fueled by a love for learning and exploring new technologies, from Flask to JavaScript, and everything in between.

🌱 Lifelong learner 📚, I'm always up for new challenges and eager to expand my skills in programming languages and frameworks. Whether it’s developing games, designing web applications, or solving tech puzzles, I'm constantly refining my craft.

💡 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, staying inspired by the world around me 🌍, or brainstorming projects that can make a positive impact.
